1.(A quick tip for anyone finding this issue before a newer version fixes things: I got rid of the warnings by downgrading to the latest RubyGems that doesn't have the deprecation warning:)
┌─[pr3sh@parrot]─[~]
└──╼ $ gem update --system 3.0.6

-----------At the end of installation you get this--------------
RubyGems installed the following executables:
	/usr/bin/gem2.7
	/usr/bin/bundle2.7


2. this installs updates for your ruby
┌─[pr3sh@parrot]─[~]
└──╼ apt update && apt install -y  ruby-dev


--------------------- DISK CLEAN ---------------------------------------

apt-get clean : flushes the cache of packages that are to be installed, right? So isn't the worst scenario that can happen is that I have to download the package again?

apt-get autoclean : does the same thing as apt-get clean except it does not remove the cache of the latest version, so it's even "safer" than the worst case scenario of apt-get clean, right?

apt-get autoremove : "removes orphaned packages that were installed as dependencies, but are no longer.

Thanks.
